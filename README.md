ðŸ“Œ Project Goal
The goal of this project is to:

Provide farmers with data-driven guidance.

Reduce crop failure due to poor weather understanding.

Maximize crop yield and farming efficiency.

ðŸš€ Features
Loads weather data from a CSV file (e.g., Kaggle datasets).

Analyzes environmental factors like:

Rainfall

Temperature

Humidity

Suggests the most suitable crops for the current conditions.

Simple and easy to use, written in pure Python
